# How Websites Work

Let's delve into how websites work and understand the roles of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## The Role of Browsers

To access a webpage, you need a browser, such as Chrome, Safari, or Firefox. These software tools help you look up the IP address of the website and receive data to render the beautiful websites we see.

## Types of Files

The data you receive from the server usually consists of three types of files: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. These files play distinct roles in building a website.

- ### HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language)

HTML (Structure) is responsible for defining the structure of your website. Think of it as the builder who constructs the walls and layout of a house. With HTML code, you create the framework of your website, adding elements like images, buttons, and text boxes.

- ### CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) 

CSS (Styling)  files handle the styling of your website, much like painters and decorators beautify a house. CSS code allows you to specify how your website should look. You can define styles like button color, text color, font choices, and more.

- ### JavaScript 

JavaScript (Behavior) is the code that enables your website to perform actions and have behavior. It's like the electrician connecting wires or the plumber making the toilet flush in a house. JavaScript adds functionality to your website.

## How It Works Together

Consider the example of the Google website. When you receive files from Google's server, loading the HTML file shows you the website's structure, including images, buttons, and text boxes. CSS files modify the appearance to match Google's design. Finally, JavaScript files bring interactivity and functionality to the website.
