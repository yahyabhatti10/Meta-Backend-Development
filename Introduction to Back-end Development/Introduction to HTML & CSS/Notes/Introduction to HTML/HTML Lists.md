# HTML Lists

HTML lists allow web developers to group a set of related items in lists. There aee two types of lists:
- Ordered List
- Unordered List

## 1. Ordered List
Start with a subtitle, like "My Hobbies," and then create an ordered list using the `<ol>` (ordered list) element. Within the ordered list, use the `<li>` element to list your hobbies.

```html
<h3>My Hobbies</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Beer brewing</li>
  <li>Martial arts</li>
  <li>Motorcycles</li>
</ol>
```

## 2. Unordered (Bullet) List

To create a bullet point list in HTML, we'll use the `<ul>` (unordered list) element for the list as a whole and the `<li>` (list item) element for each individual bullet point. Here's a simple example:

```html
<ul>
  <li>The complete iOS App development Bootcamp</li>
  <li>Another course or item</li>
</ul>
```
