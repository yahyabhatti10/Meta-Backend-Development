# Introduction to HTML: The Building Blocks of Websites

In this section, let's explore what HTML is and how we use it to structure websites.

## The Role of Browsers

Regardless of the browser you use, such as Chrome, Safari, or Firefox, their primary function is to interpret files like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to display websites. For instance, consider this simple HTML code:

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Hello</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Hello World</h1>
</body>
</html>
```
When you pass this code to your browser, it renders a webpage with the specified title and a heading.

## HTML as the Foundation

HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) serves as the foundation of all websites. Websites typically require HTML as a fundamental component, whereas CSS and JavaScript complement it. Even though a website created solely with HTML may not look modern, it can display text and various elements, including images, forms, and tables.

## Understanding Markup Languages

HTML is a type of markup language, and the term "markup" is crucial. Other markup languages like XML (Extensible Markup Language) or GML (Generalized Markup Language) share a historical basis with HTML. In the past, editors used markup to annotate manuscripts, indicating changes or specifying layout and structure for publishers. Similarly, HTML uses tags to define the layout and structure of a webpage.

## HTML Tags and Structure

HTML tags are enclosed in angular brackets (`<` and `>`). It's essential to open and close tags properly. For example, an `<h1>` tag denotes the largest heading, and you close it with `</h1>`. The importance of closing tags correctly is evident; otherwise, unintended formatting can occur.

## Creating Structure with Headings

HTML headings range from `<h1>` (largest) to `<h6>` (smallest). To create a large title, use `<h1>`. For subheadings or smaller titles, employ `<h2>`, `<h3>`, and so on, incrementally decreasing the size. HTML heading tags offer a structured hierarchy.


## Adding Line Breaks

To replicate the spacing between lines, HTML uses the `<br>` element, representing a line break. Unlike many HTML elements, `<br>` doesn't require both an opening and closing tag. It provides a simple way to create space between lines in your HTML content.
