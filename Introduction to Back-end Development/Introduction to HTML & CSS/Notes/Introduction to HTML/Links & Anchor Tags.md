# Adding Hyperlinks to Your Website

To incorporate hyperlinks into your website using the HTML `<a>` (anchor) element. The `<a>` element allows you to create clickable links that navigate users to other web pages or resources.

## Understanding Hyperlinks

HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language, and the "hypertext" part refers to the ability to link different text documents together using hyperlinks. When you click on a hyperlink, it takes you to a different text document or web page, creating a connected web of information.

## Creating Hyperlinks

To create a hyperlink, you use the `<a>` element with the `href` attribute, which specifies the destination URL or resource. The text enclosed between the opening and closing `<a>` tags becomes the clickable link text.

Here's the basic structure of an anchor tag:

```html
<a href="https://example.com">Link Text</a>
```

In the above example, "https://example.com" is the URL to which the link points, and "Link Text" is the text that users will click on.

## Adding Links to Your Website

Let's add some hyperlinks to your website. For instance, you might want to link to external websites, specific pages, or resources related to your content. Here's how you can create links:

### External Website Link

To link to an external website, use the following code:

```html
<a href="https://appbrewery.co">The App Brewery</a>
```

In this example, "The App Brewery" will be a clickable link that takes users to the App Brewery website.

### Linking to Local Pages

You can also create links to other pages within your website. For this, create a new HTML file (e.g., hobbies.html) within the same directory as your homepage (index.html). Then, use the filename as the `href` attribute to link to that page:

```html
<a href="hobbies.html">My Hobbies</a>
```
