   Inside the "index.html" file, you can quickly insert HTML boilerplate code using Atom's Emmet plugin. Type "HTML" and press "Enter," or use the shortcut (e.g., type "!" and press "Tab" or "Enter").

## Understanding the HTML Boilerplate
### Structure
   - The HTML boilerplate code comprises key elements:
     - `<!DOCTYPE html>`: Declares the HTML version as HTML5.
     - `<html>`: Represents the root HTML element.
     - `<head>`: Contains metadata and information about the webpage.
       - `<meta charset="UTF-8">`: Specifies UTF-8 character encoding for international character support.
       - Other `<meta>` elements can provide additional information for browsers and search engines.
       - `<title>`: Sets the webpage's title, displayed in the browser tab.
     - `<body>`: Houses the content visible on the webpage.


### Character Encoding (UTF-8)
UTF-8 is the recommended character encoding to ensure compatibility with international characters and emojis. It's crucial for correct rendering across various browsers and languages.

This is how HTML Boilerplate looks like:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Document</title>
</head>
<body>
    
</body>
</html>
```
