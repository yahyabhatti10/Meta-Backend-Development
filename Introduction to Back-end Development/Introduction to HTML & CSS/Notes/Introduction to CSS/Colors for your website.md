# Colors for your website

### Changing the Background Color

To start making our website more appealing, let's change the plain white background to a colored one. Open the `index.html` file in your code editor.

Inside the `<body>` tag, add a `style` attribute to change the background color. Let's begin with a simple blue color:

```html
<body style="background-color: blue;">
  <!-- Your website content goes here -->
</body>
```

### Choosing Colors

You can use named colors or hexadecimal values. To find beautiful color palettes, visit [colorhunt.co](https://colorhunt.co/) for curated palettes with hex codes.

### Using Hexadecimal Colors

Replace "blue" with a hex color code (e.g., `#66cc99`) to customize the background color:

```html
<body style="background-color: #66cc99;">
  <!-- Your website content goes here -->
</body>
```

The [Pigments](#) plugin in your editor may highlight the color for you. Save the file and refresh the website to see the new color.

### Using Named Colors

You can also use named colors from a list of predefined options. For example, to use "powder blue" as the background color:

```html
<body style="background-color: powderblue;">
  <!-- Your website content goes here -->
</body>
```
